note: Flexible qualifying guidelines, low down payments.
description: FHA loans are ideal for first time home buyers or those most interested in contributing a lower down payment. Unlike the vast majority of lenders, we fully adhere to FHA guidelines without adding our own restrictions. This is huge for customers as FHA can allow as low as a 500 credit score in certain situations. Typically, FHA require only 3.5% down (10% for credit scores 579 and lower) and has more flexible qualifying guidelines than conforming loans.
