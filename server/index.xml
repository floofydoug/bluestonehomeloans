      <description>Bluestone Home Loans was created to better serve the needs of the customer. Our founder, Matt McMahon, learned the business as a loan officer at a large regional bank. He valued his time there and worked with many outstanding individuals. However, he also noticed general inefficiencies that any large financial institution faces that didnâ€™t seem to directly help the customer and could be improved upon. Costly marketing efforts, layers of management, expensive and unused office space, employee turnover, misaligned incentives; these are just some of the costs that add up and ultimately cost the consumer more money.</description>
